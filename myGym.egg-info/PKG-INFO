Description: # mygym_train
        
        
        ## Description
        This branch trains the policy on the sim environment mygym.
        
        
        ## Original Repo
        ```
        https://github.com/incognite-lab/mygym.git
        ```
        
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        git clone -b mygym_train git@github.com:automl-private/Sim2Real-HPs.git
        cd Sim2Real-HPs
        
        conda create -n mygym_train python=3.7
        conda activate mygym_train
        
        # Install for usage
        python setup.py develop
        
        # Install for development
        make install-dev
        
        # Install stable-baselines3 for the using of sac algorithm
        pip install stable-baselines3[extra]==1.5.0
        
        cd myGym
        
        # Check, whether the toolbox works
        sh ./speed_checker.sh
        ```
        
        
        ## Work points
        ```
        1. a new kuka robot model file with 6 joints motors (envs/robots/kuka_magenetic_gripper_sdf/kong.urdf)
           and modify utils/helpers to link the new model file
        
        2. a new config file to train pnp on kong.urdf (configs/train_pnp_kong.json)
        
        3. modify train.py to use stable-baselines3 and save by pytorch, and also modify utils/callbacks.py to 
           solve comming error from this change
        
        4. a trained policy from mygym (model_torch.pth.tar)
        ```
        
        
        ## Minimal Example
        ```
        cd myGym
        
        # Train policy on mygym by using kong and pnp
        python train.py --config ./configs/train_pnp_kong.json
        ```
